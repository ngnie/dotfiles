If you get viminized in the fuzzy way, it will be like an infection. It will not go away and you will not look back. So, if you have a person(s) that you care about - or a dog - then please remember to prioritize them, and also remember to go out, listen to the birds, hug a tree once in a while - or introduce vim, to all of them.
