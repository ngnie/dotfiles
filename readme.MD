# Dotfiles
Dotfiles to setup developer workflow on arch linux using dwm, nvim, tmux, zsh, fzf, rg etc..

Some years ago I started my journey with vim and neovim. It has become an addiction. I promise you, if you start on it, not to mention fzf, you will get infected. And your mind will be occupied around all the ideas that you suddenly start to think about. Not to mention all the existing solutions that you constantly want to tweak, simply because you learn. Why? You might ask. I can mention a lot of reasons, but if I start, the point will get lost in details. Everything gets "viminized" and fuzzy. Basically you just take control of your workflow and the way you use your computer, in this case, linux. 

You're most welcome to send an email about errors and/or ideas. Thanks.

If you have a wife, girlfriend, children.. or a dog.. then please remember to prioritize them - also remember to go out, listen to the birds, hug a tree - once in a while - or introduce vim to them all.
