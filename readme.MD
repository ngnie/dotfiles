# Dotfiles
Dotfiles to setup developer workflow on arch linux using dwm, nvim, tmux, zsh, fzf, rg etc..

Some years ago I started my journey with vim. Later I found out about Neovim. Regardless, vim has become a disease, a virus. I promise you, if you start on it, not to mention fzf, you will get infected. And your mind will be occupied around all the ideas that you suddenly start to think of and improve solutions that you already made, just because you learn. Why? You might ask. I can give you a lot of reasons, but if I start, the point will get lost in details. The point is that everything gets "viminized". It is just another way of using a computer. In this context, linux. Ps if you have a wife, kids, girlfriend or a dog, then please remember to prioritize your time, listen to the birds or hug a tree, or introduce vim to them all. Otherwise you get lonely :-)
